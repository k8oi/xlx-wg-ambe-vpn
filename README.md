# xlx-wg-ambe-vpn
XLX AMBE Server running behind DHCP or non Data Center location using point-to-point WireGuard VPN
<h3>Purpose</h3>
Run a XLX server in a datacenter with a static, public facing IP address with the ability to provide multi-protocol service for D-Plus, DMR, and YSF/C4FM. The AMBE server will run in a differt location than the XLX server - home, different data center, whereever. 

The AMBE server will also be able to reside "behind" a dynamically changing, public facing IP address. Meaning - you can run it at home behind your regular firewall with no changes to the network.
